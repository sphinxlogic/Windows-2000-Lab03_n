The syntax for NMAKE is:

NMAKE [option...] [macros...] [targets...] [@commandfile...]

NMAKE builds only specified targets or, if none is specified, the first target 
in the makefile. The first makefile target can be a pseudotarget that builds 
other targets. NMAKE uses makefiles specified with /F; if /F is not specified, 
it uses the Makefile file in the current directory. If no makefile is specified, 
it uses inference rules to build command-line targets.

The commandfile text file contains command-line input. Other input can precede 
or follow @commandfile. A path is permitted. In commandfile, line breaks are 
treated as spaces. Enclose macro definitions in quotation marks if they contain spaces.


NMAKE options are described in the following table. 

Options are preceded by either a slash (/) or a dash (–) and are not case sensitive. 
Use !CMDSWITCHES to change option settings in a makefile.

Option          Action
-----------     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
/A              Forces build of all evaluated targets, even if not out-of-date with 
                respect to dependents. Does not force build of unrelated targets.

/B              Forces build even if timestamps are equal. Recommended only for very 
                fast systems (resolution of two seconds or less).
 
/C              Suppresses default output, including nonfatal NMAKE errors or warnings, 
                timestamps, and NMAKE copyright message. Suppresses warnings issued by /K.
 
/D              Displays timestamps of each evaluated target and dependent and a message 
                when a target does not exist. Useful with /P for debugging a makefile.
                Use !CMDSWITCHES to set or clear /D for part of a makefile.
 
/E              Causes environment variables to override makefile macro definitions.
 
/F filename     Specifies filename as a makefile. Spaces or tabs can precede filename. 
                Specify /F once for each makefile. To supply a makefile from standard
                input, specify a dash (–) for filename, and end keyboard input with 
                either F6 or CTRL+Z.
 
/HELP, /?       Displays a brief summary of NMAKE command-line syntax.
 
/I              Ignores exit codes from all commands. To set or clear /I for part of a
                makefile, use !CMDSWITCHES. To ignore exit codes for part of a makefile,
                use a dash (–) command modifier or .IGNORE. Overrides /K if both
                are specified.
 
/K              Continues building unrelated dependencies, if a command returns an error.
                Also issues a warning and returns an exit code of 1. By default, 
                NMAKE halts if any command returns a nonzero exit code. 
                Warnings from /K are suppressed by /C; /I overrides /K if both are specified.
 
/N              Displays but does not execute commands; preprocessing commands are executed.
                Does not display commands in recursive NMAKE calls. Useful for debugging
                makefiles and checking timestamps. To set or clear /N for part of a makefile,
                use !CMDSWITCHES.
 
/NOLOGO         Suppresses the NMAKE copyright message.
 
/P              Displays information (macro definitions, inference rules, targets, 
                .SUFFIXES list) to standard output, and then runs the build.
                If no makefile or command-line target exists, it displays information only. 
                Use with /D to debug a makefile.
 
/Q              Checks timestamps of targets; does not run the build. Returns a zero exit
                code if all targets are up-to-date and a nonzero exit code if any target 
                is not. Preprocessing commands are executed. Useful when running NMAKE
                from a batch file.
 
/R              Clears the .SUFFIXES list and ignores inference rules and macros that are 
                predefined.
 
/S              Suppresses display of executed commands. To suppress display in part of a 
                makefile, use the @ command modifier or .SILENT. To set or clear /S for 
                part of a makefile, use !CMDSWITCHES.
 
/T              Updates timestamps of command-line targets (or first makefile target)
                and executes preprocessing commands but does not run the build.
 
/U              Must be used in conjunction with /N. Dumps inline NMAKE files so that 
                the /N output can be used as a batch file.
 
/X filename     Sends NMAKE error output to filename instead of standard error. Spaces or 
                tabs can precede filename. To send error output to standard output, 
                specify a dash (–) for filename. Does not affect output from commands 
                to standard error.

/Y              Disables batch-mode inference rules. When this option is selected, 
                all batch-mode inference rules are treated as regular inference rules.


NMAKE returns the following exit codes.

Code            Meaning
--------        -------------------------------------------------------
0               No error (possibly a warning)

1               Incomplete build (issued only when /K is used)

2               Program error, possibly due to one of the following:
                    A syntax error in the makefile 
                    An error or exit code from a command 
                    An interruption by the user 

4               System error—out of memory

255             Target is not up-to-date (issued only when /Q is used)
