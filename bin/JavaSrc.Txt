                   Microsoft Visual J++ : JAVASRC
========================================================================

JavaSrc is a utility for extracting .JAVA files from a .ZIP file. You can 
use it to extract the source files for the Java class libraries from the
Microsoft version of CLASSES.ZIP. This allows you to perform source-level 
debugging into the Java class libraries. 

To extract the .JAVA files from CLASSES.ZIP, use the following command:

    javasrc classes.zip

This creates a directory tree below the directory that CLASSES.ZIP resides
in, containing the source files for the Java class libraries. Note that
these files require approximately four megabytes of disk space.

To remove the .JAVA files that were extracted from CLASSES.ZIP, use the 
following command:

    javasrc -classes.zip

You can also extract the .JAVA files by running the Visual J++ Setup 
program and choosing a Custom installation. Select "Java Class Library 
Source Code," clear the check boxes for everything else, and then continue. 

If you get an updated version of CLASSES.ZIP, you must re-run JavaSrc to 
update the .JAVA files.
