Dependency Walker Version 2.0 Beta 4 Release Notes

What's New in Version 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Command line options to configure module search order, column sorting, output
  files, and other settings.
* Console mode that allows Dependency Walker to be ran without its graphical
  interface being displayed.  This is useful for batch files and unattended
  automation of Dependency Walker features.
* Support for 64-bit Windows modules.
* Detection of delay-load dependencies. This is a new type of dependency that
  was introduced with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. They work on Windows 9x, Windows
  NT, and Windows 2000.
* Detection of dynamically loaded modules, including details about which module
  actually called LoadLibrary to dynamically load the module.
* Detection of dynamically called functions, including details about which
  module actually called GetProcAddress() to obtain the function address.
* C++ function name undecorating to provide human readable C++ function
  prototypes including function names, return types, and parameter types.
* User definable module search paths with support for "KnownDLLs" and the
  "App Paths" registry keys.  Search paths can be saved and loaded from within
  the graphical interface or from the command line.
* Ability to save a module's session to a text report file for easy viewing in
  any text viewer.
* Ability to save a module's session to a comma separated value (CSV) file for
  easy importing into other applications.
* Ability to save a snapshot of a module's session to an image file, which can
  be loaded by Dependency Walker at a later time on any computer.
* Module profiling to detect dynamic dependencies, child processes, thread
  activity, and exceptions. Child processes can also be profiled for their
  dependencies.
* Ability to control what file extensions Dependency Walker will add the
  "View Dependencies" menu item to a file's context menu in explorer.
* Added a hotkey to help match imports with exports, and modules in the list
  view with modules in the tree view.  Also added a hotkey to locate the an
  original module in the tree view.
* Added a new "Symbols" column which reports what type(s) of debug symbols are
  associated with each module.
* Added some new columns to the Module List View. They include Link Time Stamp,
  Actual Base, Virtual Size, and Load Order.
* Added an OS Information dialog. This information is also saved to text and
  DWI files.
* All list views can now be sorted by icon, which provides an easy way of
  grouping items of similar type.

Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  GetProcAddress calls are logged to the profile log window, but they are not
   added to the import and export function lists at this time.
*  Dependency Walker is unable to hook modules on Windows 2000 build 2031
   (Beta 3) and greater.  Modules can still be profiled, but no parent / child
   relationships for dynamic modules will be detected, nor will any
   GetProcAddress() calls be detected.
