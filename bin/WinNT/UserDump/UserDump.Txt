User Mode Process Dump Utility
------------------------------

This tool allows you to snapshot any Win32 process into a user.dmp file.
It is similar to Dr. Watson, but does not invade, debug, or terminate
the process being dumped. It is a command-line application and can be
invoked at any time, making it useful in a variety of development and
debug scenarios.
