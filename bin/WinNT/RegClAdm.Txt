RegClAdm is used to register a Cluster Administrator extension DLL both
with a cluster and with the local machine. The cluster registration adds
the CLSID of the extension DLL to the cluster allow Cluster Administrator
to find the component when displaying property sheets, wizard, and context
menus. The local machine registration allows the extension DLL component to
be found by its CLSID on that system.

This tool is only supported on Windows 2000 and later.
