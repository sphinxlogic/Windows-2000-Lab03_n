<h1 align="center">Dialog to UIDialog</h1>

<p align="left">To convert from AWT to AFC, instances of
java.awt.Dialog should be transformed into instances of
com.ms.ui.UIDialog.</p>

<p align="left">Dialog extends <a href="Window.htm"
target="descriptions">Window</a>: be sure to see its changes.</p>

<h3 align="left">Purpose and Usage</h3>

<p align="left">UIDialog extends Dialog by allowing you to
include UIComponents as part of dialogs. This gives you more
control over the user interface.</p>

<h3 align="left">Porting</h3>

<p align="left">UIDialog extends Dialog, so no changes need to be
made to create AFC applications. It is recommended, though, that
you change instances of Dialog to UIDialog, to take advantage of
increased functionality.</p>
