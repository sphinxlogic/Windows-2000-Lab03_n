<h1 align="center">Graphics to FxGraphics</h1>

<p align="left">To convert from AWT to AFC, instances of
java.awt.Graphics should be transformed into instances of
com.ms.fx.FxGraphics.</p>

<h3 align="left">Purpose and Usage</h3>

<p align="left">FxGraphics extends from Graphics, so everything
you could do before can still be done. FxGraphics, however,
provides an extended graphics object implementation and abstract
methods for cross-platform compatibility. FxGraphics adds new
drawing primitives, like <font size="2" face="Courier">draw3DRect(),</font>
<font size="2" face="Courier">drawChars(),</font> and <font
size="2" face="Courier">drawString()</font>. You can also take
advantage of the extended objects in the fx package (like FxPen
and FxTexture) to draw more complex and compelling graphics. You
can draw strings at different angles, take parts of images and
place them, expanded or contracted, onto other parts of the
screen, and try many other new graphics options.</p>

<h3 align="left">Porting</h3>

<p>FxGraphics extends Graphics, so no changes need to be made to
create AFC applications. It is recommended, though, that you
change Graphics instances to FxGraphics instances.</p>
