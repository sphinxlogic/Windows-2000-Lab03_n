<h1 align="center">CardLayout to UITabLayout</h1>

<p align="left">To convert from AWT to AFC, instances of
java.awt.CardLayout should be transformed into instances of
com.ms.ui.UITabLayout. </p>

<p align="left">CardLayout implements <a
href="LayoutManager2.htm" target="descriptions">LayoutManager2</a>:
be sure to see its changes.</p>

<h3 align="left">Purpose and Usage</h3>

<p align="left">AFC does not provide a direct transformation for
CardLayout in the UILayoutManager. Instead, CardLayout is
replaced by UITabLayout, which provides a layout manager for a
set of tab controls and their pages, which is an improvement on
the idea behind CardLayout. UITabViewer, the object that uses
UITabLayout as its layout manager, can include UITabs with all
types of UIComponents embedded inside.</p>

<h3 align="left">Porting</h3>

<p align="left">There is no direct port of CardLayout: you will
need to use UITabLayout instead. </p>
