Overview

The Microsoft(R) Windows NT/2000(R) Debugging Tools are a set of tools 
provided by the Windows 2000 Debug team.  This includes a few debuggers 
and related tools.  It is intended to be used by application developers, 
driver developers, and administrators.  

These debugging tools were previously shipped in separate distribution 
channels; with this release, they are being consolidating into a single, 
complete set to ship.  These tools will be available in each of these 
products: 

 - Platform SDK (MSDN CD and web site)
 - Windows 2000 DDK (MSDN CD and web site)
 - Windows 2000 Customer Support Diagnostics CD

Note: Debugging requires using a user account with Administrive rights.
If you are not familiar with debugging, experimentation can crash
processes, and the the operating system. Only experienced users and
developers should debug.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New

- Most changes from RC 1 to RC 2 are bugfixes, to increase debugger 
stability.  

- The debuggers now handle 64-bit debugging, both in terms of kernel wire
protocol and the extension dll interface.  You must use current debuggers
to debug RC 2.  If you load a 32-bit extension dll you may see a warning
that this 32-bit dll may not work.  This is just a warning, if you see
actual problems report it to Microsoft Product Support. 

- New IIS Exception Monitor Tool has been added.

- OEM Support Tools have been added.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Issues

- Uninstallation of the debugger tools are not working in this release.

- If there are multiple versions of debugger extension DLLs in your PATH, 
older verions might incorrectly get loaded.  There have been some 
improvements in the area of debugger extension DLLs which make this kind 
of problem more common, in some situations.  See below for more 
information. Use the !listexts to find out where it was loaded from.

- Win64 widening of debugger extension DLL source code is expected to 
occur between Windows 2000 Beta 3 and final release.  At this point, 
developers which have debugger extensions should expect to make small 
modifications to their source code to widen from Win32 to Win64.

Programs

This distribution includes the following debuggers:

	windbg.exe - Windbg debugger
	windbg.hlp - Windbg debugger online documentation
	windbgrm.exe - Windbg Remote
	dbgwiz.exe - Windbg Configuration Wizard
	alphakd.exe - Kernel Debugger for Alpha systems
	i386kd.exe - Kernel Debugger for x86 systems
	ntsd.exe - NTSD Debugger
	cdb.exe - CDB Debugger (variant of NTSD)

On Windows 2000, ntsd.exe ships with the operating system, in 
%systemroot%\system32, and is not included in this distribution.

This distribution also includes these debugger-related tools:

	gflags.exe - Global Flags utility
	dumpchk.exe - Dump Check utility
	breakin.exe - BreakIn utility
	remote.exe - Remote utility
	kill.exe - Process Kill utility
	list.exe - File List utility

Another related tool which ships with the operating system is:

	drwtsn32.exe - Dr. Watson utility

Windbg is the main debugger produced by the Windows 2000 Debugger 
development team.  NTSD and KD are provided for those familiar with these 
debuggers, and in scenerios where Windbg may not support (or have a 
problem with) some particular operation.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debugger Extensions

Debugger Extensions are DLLs which Windbg, NTSD, and KD can use to provide 
additional debugger commands.  The following extensions are included with 
this release: 

	gdikdx.dll   
	kdextalp.dll 
	kdextx86.dll 
	ntsdexts.dll
	rpcexts.dll  
	userexts.dll 
	userkdx.dll  
	vdmexts.dll  

The debugger extension DLLs are operating system version, build, platform, 
and debug/retail specific.  Multiple versions of each DLL are included, to 
provide the necessary files for each variant.  Additional DLLs have been 
released for Windows NT 4.  All DLLs are provided in both debug and retail 
versions.  The free and checked versions of these DLLs for Windows NT 4.0 
and this build of Windows 2000 are installed into four subdirectories, 
under the target subdirectory: 

	nt4chk
	nt4fre
	w2kchk
	w2kfre
	
The debugger has awareness of these subdirectories, and will not be able
to find them if these subdirectories are renamed or moved. If a custom
extension DLL is to be used, it should be placed in the PATH, refer to 
the Windbg online documentation for more details.

For Windows 2000, ntsdexts.dll ships with the operating system, in 
%systemroot%\system32, and is not included in this distribution.

The method that Windbg uses to search for debugger extension DLLs is:

1. Search the current directory which the debugger was loaded from.
2. Search the PATH environment variable.
3. Look at the registry key, which is set when the debugger is installed.
   Look at the subdirectory listed in 
   "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\W2KDBG\Directories\Install Dir". If C:\FOO,
   the the debugger looks in C:\FOO\nt4fre, C:\FOO\nt4chk, C:\FOO\w2kfre, 
   and C:\FOO\w2kchk, based on the appropriate OS version (4 or 5) and type
   (free or checked).
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install Directory and Start Menus

Depending on which kit was installed, the subdirectory in which these tools
are installed in varies. Using the Setup program from each kit, the
subdirectory can be specified. 

For the Platform SDK, the default location for these files is 
<drive>:\mssdk\bin.  For the Windows 2000 DDK, the default location for 
these files is <drive>:\ntddk\bin.  

Similarly, the Start menu for these tools will vary based on which kit they
are installed from. This path works for on all distributions:

    Start -> Programs -> Debugging Tools
    
This path works for the Windows 2000 DDK:

    Start -> Programs -> Development Kits -> Windows 2000 DDK -> Debugging Tools
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operating System- and Version-Specific Information

The KD and NTSD debuggers are intended to debug systems running the curent 
version of Windows 2000.  There are many cases where these versions of 
these two debuggers will not work with previous releases of the operating 
system.  KD and NTSD are not designed to be used on Microsoft Windows 95 
or Microsoft Windows 98.  

The Windbg debugger makes an effort to work with the current and
previous major releases of the operating system, so it should work on
Windows NT 4.0 and this build of Windows 2000. 

Windbg can be used for simple (one-system) debugging scenerios of Win32 
user-mode applications on Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98.  
Windbg cannot be used to debug kernel-mode drivers on Windows 9x, the WDeb 
debugger (which ships in the Windows 9x DDK) should be used for this.

To debug a Windows NT 4.0 system using KD or NTSD, use the versions of 
KD and NTSD that ship in the \support subdirectory in the Windows NT
4.0 CD. In addition to the debugger extensions provided in that
directory, this current debugger distribution includes more extensions
(including checked versions), in the nt4chk and nt4fre subdirectories.

Debugger Documentation 

For documtation on how to use these debuggers and related tools, see the
Windbg online help (windbg.hlp) and the debugger online help (debugger.hlp). 
Also, see the debugging chapters of the various kits, which discuss debugging 
for different target audiences:

 - Platform SDK online documentation
 - Windows 2000 DDK online documentation
 - Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit online documentation

In future releases, the DDK will have more extensive debugger documentation.
