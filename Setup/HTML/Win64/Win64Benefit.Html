<strong>benefit</strong> your enterprise?
</font>

<ol>
<li>64 bits brings more <strong>productivity</strong>.
<p>When your applications run faster, more work gets done.  Knowledge workers spend their time thinking and producing 
rather than waiting for the computer to finish its tasks.
<p>
</p>
<li>64-bits can bring <strong>lower cost</strong>.  
<p>Each server in your computing environment will support larger numbers of users and applications.  
Fewer servers will be needed to do the job. This translates directly into less complex and costly system and network 
management overhead &#151 one of the 
highest costs in any computing system.
<p>
</p>
<li>64-bits opens up new application <strong>opportunities</strong>.
<p>New applications will be designed without the 
        barriers imposed by 32-bit systems today. Larger and faster Internet 
        servers can be built. New graphics applications will make work easier 
        and more enjoyable. Data intensive tasks that are impossible today can 
        easily be done with the flexibility that 64-bit Windows NT will 
        provide.
