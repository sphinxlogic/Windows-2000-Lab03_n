<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="+1">Why should you care about 64-Bit Windows NT?
</font>
</center>
<p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">First let's look at what a 64-bit Windows NT system will do that is different from what happens today on a 32-bit Windows NT system.  
<p>A 64-bit system will support far more physical 
<strong>memory
</strong> that a 32-bit system.   More memory translates to greater 
<strong>scalability
</strong> &#151; for applications, for users, for data, and for performance. In simple 
numbers, a 32-bit Windows NT system can support 
<strong>4
</strong> Gbytes of memory.  A 64-bit Windows NT system will support 
<strong>16 TB 
</strong> of memory.  
<ol>
<li>A 64-bit Windows NT system can provide more 
<strong>memory
</strong> to run 
<strong>applications
</strong>.   
<p>The amount of available memory in a 64-bit Windows NT system is realistically constrained only by the physical 
capacity of the system to hold the memory boards.  This abundance of physical memory translates into several application 
benefits.
<p>Each application on the system can support more 
<strong>users
</strong>.   All or part of each application on any system must be replicated for each user.  This replication requires 
memory. On a 64-bit Windows NT system, many more users can access any given application because much more memory can be 
supported on the system.
<p>The applications can run at much higher levels of 
<strong>performance
</strong> on a 64-bit Windows NT system.  Again, the amount of physical memory supported on a 64-bit system allows 
many more applications to run simultaneously and remain completely resident in the system's main memory. This reduces 
or eliminates the performance penalty of swapping pieces of applications to and from disk.   The performance advantage 
of 64-bit Windows NT is especially evident in the largest applications, such as those in ERP or financial and scientific 
modeling.
<p>
</p>
<li>A 64-bit Windows NT system can provide much more 
<strong>memory
</strong> for 
<strong>data
</strong> storage and manipulation.
<p>
<strong>Databases
</strong> can store more of their data in the physical memory of the system.  In some cases, entire databases could operate as memory-resident.   Access to data will be faster since a disk read is not necessary.  This also drives 
up the performance of the application using the database.
<p>Applications can 
<strong>manipulate
</strong> data more easily and more reliably.  Huge data structures can be created in memory.  Video composition for motion 
picture work requires 64-bit systems today.  Modeling for scientific and financial applications benefits greatly from 
memory resident data structures not possible on 32-bit systems.  Today, these and a growing number of memory dependent 
applications are run on expensive UNIX workstations and servers.  64-bit Windows NT will bring these applications to 
industry-standard platforms.
