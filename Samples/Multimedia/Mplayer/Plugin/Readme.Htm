<H2>Media Player Plug-in for Web Browsers</H2>
<P>The plug-in samples demonstrates how to use the Media Player plug-in to create Web pages for all Plug-in enabled browsers. 
<p>The HTML source code can be found in the \DxMedia\Samples\Plugin folder. This sample consists of the following files:
<UL>
<LI><B><a href="sample1.htm" target="_blank">sample1.htm</a> (Embedding Only)</B>: A self contained, browser agnostic example of the HTML code snippet necessary for basic Media Player control embedding.<p>
<LI><B><a href="sample2.htm" target="_blank">sample2.htm</a> (Embedding with Properties/Methods)</B>: A self contained, browser agnostic example which utilizes an embeded player control to demonstrate how to use properties and methods exposed by the plug-in.<p>
<LI><B><a href="sample3.htm" target="_blank">sample3.htm</a> (Script Event handling)</B>: This file incorporates Script Event handling, in the form of "alert boxes" which will become visable whenever (a) the state of the player control changes, or (b) a script command is received from the media stream.  In this case, the script commands are text strings which contain a transcript of the narration.<p>
<LI><B><a href="sample4.htm" target="_blank">sample4.htm</a> (Advanced Script Event handling)</B>: The behavior is the same as Sample #3, but this time the HTML script uses external Javascript include files (.js) as containers for the scripting necessary to receive and handle the methods and events.<p>
<LI><B><a href="sample5.htm" target="_blank">sample5.htm</a> (Advanced All Browser Script Event handling)</B>: The behavior is the same as Sample #3 and #4, but this time the HTML script uses external Javascript include files (.js) as containers for the scripting necessary to receive and handle the methods and events.  Plus the sample includes VBScript to handle Internet Explorer events on the same page.  This is one page fits all.<p>
<LI><B>demo.asf</B>: This file contains the multimedia content used by all samples.
</UL>

<P><B>These samples to are fully documented in the NetShow Web Plug-in
portion of the SDK documenttaion.</B>
