README for DXSurface Example 3

This sample shows a fractal being rendered translucently over a parrot.

USAGE:
     c:\> dxsurf3.exe [-width xxx -height yyy -bpp zzz -windowed]
              xxx specifies the width in pixels of the window, e.g. 1024
              yyy specifies the height in pixels of the window, e.g. 768
              zzz specifies the bits-per-pixel of the window, e.g. 16
              -windowed indicates whether to run in a window or fullscreen

This sample demonstrates:
- using a DXSurface in fullscreen and windowed mode
- loading an image onto a DXSurface
- directly manipulating the Alpha, Red, Green, and Blue components of pixels
- using GDI operations on DXSurfaces
- using a DXTransform to scale a DXSurface to fit the window
  (Use this instead of StretchBlt() to preserve alpha quality.)
