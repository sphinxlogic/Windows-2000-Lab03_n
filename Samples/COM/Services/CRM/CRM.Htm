<h2>Compensating Resource Manager</h2>

<hr>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The Compensating Resource Manager (CRM) feature of COM+ allows quick and easy
development of resources than can participate in a two phase commit with MS DTC
transactions. </p>

<p>Compensating Resource Managers (CRMs) are a mechanism by which non-transactional
resources can participate in a 2 phase commit transaction with DTC, and hence with other
transactional resources such as a database. CRMs do this by providing the capability to
reverse their work by using a compensating action. The compensating action can roll back
the normal action performed by the CRM as part of the transaction. The CRM developer
provides both the normal action plus the compensating action. The CRM infrastructure (part
of COM+) calls the compensating action only if the transaction aborts. </p>

<p>Typically CRMs do not provide the isolation capabilities of full resource managers, but
they do provide transactional atomicity (all or nothing) and durability via a log. A CRM
is developed as a pair of COM components, the CRM Worker and the CRM Compensator. </p>

<p>The CRM Worker is responsible for performing the normal action as part of the
transaction. This action is specific to the particular type of CRM, and is accessed via a
CRM specific interface. The CRM Worker will write records to a durable log via a defined
interface so that in case of failure, recovery can be performed. The CRM Worker must
perform write ahead - that is, it must write the log records for the action (and make them
durable) prior to actually performing the action. This is to ensure that the record of the
action (which might be used to roll back, or compensate for, the action) is durable in
case of a failure. Note also that this implies that the compensating action - and indeed,
all the actions, are idempotent, or can be performed again and will lead to the same
state.</p>

<p>The CRM Compensator is responsible for providing the compensating action to be
performed in the case of an abort, and also provides a clean up action for the case where
the transaction commits. This clean up action can be used to clean up any state that was
being maintained in case the transaction had to be rolled back.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We provide the following samples for the Compensating Resource Manager: 

<ul>
  <li>CrmDebug. This sample is a CRM Compensator that 
  simply outputs debug messages for all CRM Compensator notifications. It is 
  written in C++ and uses the ActiveX Template Library (ATL). It can be used as 
  a temporary substitute for your own CRM Compensator while developing your CRM. 
  It implements both ICrmCompensator and ICrmCompensatorVariants. 
  <li>CrmFiles. This sample is a Compensating Resource 
  Manager (CRM) that creates and deletes files. It implements a CRM Worker that 
  provides an interface for creating or deleting files, and a CRM Compensator 
  which implements ICrmCompensator to receive transaction outcome notifications. 
  The CRM Compensator also implements ICrmFormatLogRecords to support 
  monitoring. This CRM can be installed in a server application or in a library 
  application for use by multiple server applications. The CRM Worker requires a 
  transaction. The CRM Compensator should not have a transaction 
  <li>CrmFilesVB. Visual Basic version of CrmFiles. It 
  shows how the CRM interfaces can be used for logging from VB, and how the 
  ICrmCompensatorVariants interface can be implemented on a VB component. Note 
  that you must build and register CrmFiles.dll before building this VB project 
  because that defines the interface implemented by CrmFilesVB. 
  <li>crmfilesvj. Visual J++ version of CrmFiles. It shows 
  how the CRM interfaces can be used for logging from VJ, and how the 
  ICrmCompensatorVariants interfaces can be implemented on a VJ component. Note 
  that you must run crmfilesvj/GenerateJavaWrappersAndTLB.cmd before building 
  this VJ project. This batch file generates Java wrappers for the components in %SystemRoot%\system32\comsvcs.dll
  and compiles the type library for crmfilesvj.dll.
  <li>CrmFilesTest. This is a test component and user 
  interface that can be used to drive any of the CrmFiles components. The test 
  component, CrmFilesTest.dll should be installed in a COM+ application. 
  FileTest.vbp is a VB project that provides the user interface 
  (FileTest.exe).&nbsp; 
  <li>CrmMonitor. This sample demonstrates the use of the CRM monitoring interfaces. It shows
    how CRM clerks in a specified transaction can be found and queried. CrmMonComp.dll is a
    component which should be installed in the application to be monitored. It does not
    require a transaction, and demonstrates the use of the following interfaces: ICrmMonitor,
    ICrmMonitorLogRecords, ICrmMonitorClerks, and ICrmFormatLogRecords. This sample also
    contains a Visual Basic project that provides a simple user interface to CrmMonComp. This
    project (Monitor.vbp) builds Monitor.exe. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Build Notes</h4>
<p><u>VC++ Samples</u></p> 
<p>To build the C++ Samples, load the CRM.dsp into Visual 
Studio. Build each project in the workspace. Optionally, go to the 
samples\com\services\crm directory and run nmake.exe. This will build all of the C++ projects in the
sample. </p>
<p><u>VB Samples</u></p> 
<P>         Next build the VB projects. 
The VB implementation of a CRM is in the CrmFilesVB directory. 
This project has a reference to CrmFiles.dll which is built&nbsp;with the 
C++ projects. Go to Project/References, if "CRM Files 1.0" is missing from your 
references, browse and add CrmFiles.dll. Once this is done, compile the project 
using File/Make CrmFilesVB.dll. In addition to the VB implementation of a CRM in the 
CrmFilesVB directory, there are two other VB projects in the CrmFilesTest and 
CrmMonitor directories. These can be compiled or run.</P>
<p><u>VJ++ Samples</u></p> 
<P>To build the VJ++ sample CRM, load the crmfilesvj.vjp into Visual Studio. Run 
the GenerateJavaWrappers.cmd. This batch file creates Java wrappers for the 
%SystemRoot%\system32\comsvcs.dll and compiles crmfilesvj.idl to produce 
crmfilesvj.tlb. Next, put the crmfilesvj sub-directory on your system classpath 
environment variable. The comsvcs and crmfilesvj class files in the 
sub-directory are required by crmfilesvj.dll. Build the comsvcs project. Then 
build the crmfilesvj project. </P>
<h4>Usage Notes</h4>

<p>If you are not familiar with COM+ explorer additional documentation can be found
under "Installing and Deploying COM+ applications" in the platform SDK documentation.</p> 

<p><u>CrmFilesTest</u></p>

<p>To use FileTest.exe -

<ol>
  <li>Create a new COM+ Application. Set the "Enable 
  Compensating Resource Managers" property for this COM+ Application 
  (Application Properties, Advanced tab). The Activation property for this COM+ 
  Application should be "Server application". 
  <li>        
          
   Install CrmFiles.dll, CrmFilesVB.dll, and crmfilesvj.dll into this COM+ Application. 
  These are the CRM components. 
  <li>   Add the crmfilesvj sub-directory to your Classpath 
  system environment variable. The   comsvcs and crmfilesvj 
  Java class files are required by crmfilesvj.dll. 
  <li>Mark the CRM Worker components as "Transaction 
  Support = Required" and enable Just In Time Activation. The CRM Compensator 
  components do not require a transaction or Just In Time Activation, so these 
  do not require any further settings. 
  <li>Install the CrmFileTest.dll component into the same 
  COM+ Application, mark it "Transaction Support = Required" and enable Just In 
  Time Activation. 
  <li>Run FileTest.exe. This is generated by the 
  FileTest.vbp VB project in the CrmFilesTest directory.&nbsp;Enter the name of the file you wish 
  to create or delete, and click either Create File or Delete File respectively. 
  Use the NT Explorer to see the file being created and deleted. 
  <li>You may select more than one CRM Compensator type in 
  the same transaction and/or perform multiple file creates or deletes in the 
  same transaction. However, do not perform create or delete on the same file 
  name more than once in the same transaction or unpredictable results will 
  occur, as CRMs do not enforce isolation. 
  <li>Once you have finished creating or deleting files, you can click either Commit or Abort
    to complete the transaction as required. Note that the VB version of the CRM uses a
    slightly different algorithm for delete file than the VC version, please see the code for
    details. </li>
</ol>

<p><u>CrmMonitor</u></p>

<p>Monitor.exe can be used in conjunction with FileTest.exe to view the active CRMs. To
use Monitor.exe -

<ol>
  <li>Install CrmMonComp.dll into the COM+ Application you 
  created above. CrmMonComp.dll does not require any further settings. 
  <li>Run Monitor.exe. This is generated by the Monitor.vbp 
  VB project in the CrmMonitor directory. 
  <li>Using FileTest.exe, create a file - this will 
  activate a CRM and a transaction. 
  <li>Copy the transaction Unit Of Work (UOW) identifier 
  for the transaction you want to monitor from the Component Services Explorer 
  (Distributed Transaction Coordinator, Transaction List). 
  <li>Paste the transaction UOW into Monitor.exe (Ctrl-V), 
  then click the Go button. This will list details of all the CRMs currently 
  involved in that transaction. 
  <li>The transaction can optionally be aborted by selecting the Abort Transaction check box
    prior to clicking Go. </li>
</ol>
