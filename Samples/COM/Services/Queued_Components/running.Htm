<H2>Setting up and running the Sample</H2>

<P>This sample does not have any UI. However, it does make ample use of OutputDebugString. Before performing these steps, you may want to run a utility like dbmon.exe or some other utility that displays the output from OutputDebugString. Note, that you can perform steps 1 and 2 at the same time.</P>

<LI><A HREF="qapp.htm">Set the "Queued" property for QCShip and QCNotify</A>. This step actually creates the underlying MSMQ queues that provide the queuing services for these Queued Components.</LI>

<LI>Run driver.exe from mssdk\samples\com\Services\Queued Components\QCSamp1\Driver\Debug. <I><STRONG>Notice that we have not started QCShip or QCNotify!</LI>
</I></STRONG><LI>driver.exe will terminate when it submits 100 orders. It submits one order per second. Again, you can observe driver.exe submitting orders via a utility like dbmon.exe. Also, using the MSMQ Snap-in, observe the messages landing in the QCShip queue (you may have to press F5 Refresh).</LI>
<LI><A HREF="listen.htm">Start the QCShip application and listener.</A> At this point, the QCShip application will begin processing the ship orders submitted by the client application driver.exe. If you have dbmon.exe (or some other utilty that can display OutputDebugString diagnostics) you will see QCShip process 100 ship orders and execute 100 queued calls to QCNotify. Also, using the MSMQ Snap-in, observe the messages landing in the QCNotify queue (you may have to press F5 Refresh).</LI>
<LI>When QCShip completes, <A HREF="listen.htm">start the QCNotify application and listener</A>. You will see QCNotify start processing the notifications submitted by QCShip. Again it is instructive to see what's going on with dbmon.exe. Also, using the MSMQ Snap-in, observe that all queued messages have been processed.</LI>
<LI>You can rerun driver.exe with QCShip and QCNotify both up and running. The application behaves identically if QCShip and QCNotify are available or not.</LI>
<LI>You can also run multiple instances of driver.exe.</LI></OL>
