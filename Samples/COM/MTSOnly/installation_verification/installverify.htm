<h2>Installation Verification</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Overview</h4>
 <p> We provide the Sample Bank application for you to verify the installation of your MTS or COM+ installation. The Sample Bank application is a banking services application that credits, debits, and transfers money between accounts. Running the Sample Bank application allows you to test your installation of MTS or COM+ with SQL Server 6.5 as well as practice package deployment and administration. Sample Bank has components written in Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual J++. </p>

<h4>Build Notes</h4>

<p>COM+ automatically configures the ODBC data source for Sample Bank during setup. For MTS you will need to copy over the MTSSamples.dsn from the <A HREF="">..\Installation_Verification</a> directory to &lt;System Drive&gt;\Program Files\Common Files\ODBC\Data Sources (or your default ODBC Data Source directory). Since the local machine is used by default, you must have SQL Server 6.5 installed on your local machine. By default, the MTS or COM+ DSN points to SQL Server 6.5. If you are using a database other than SQL Server 6.5, you must delete the DSN and add a new DSN called MTSSamples that points to your database.</p>

<p>If you want to use a SQL Server installation on another machine, use the ODBC service icon in the Control Panel to modify your data source as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Data Sources dialog box, click the File DSN tab, and select the MTSSamples data source.
<li>Click Configure and enter the name of the server you want to use.
</ul>

<p>Note that the Login ID and Password specified by the MTSSamples DSN are not used by Sample Bank. Sample Bank uses the "sa" account and null password. If your system administrator password is non-null or you want to specify a different login ID, you will have to modify the ODBC connection string in the Sample Bank source code. </p>


<H5>Installing Sample Bank Application (MTS only)</H5> 
If you are targeting MTS you will need to install the Sample Bank application.  (If you are targeting
COM+ the Sample Bank application is installed automatically when COM+ is installed.)  
To install the Sample Bank application:

<OL>
	<LI>Create the vcacct.dll by building account.dsw from <A HREF="account.vc/">account.vc</A>.
	<LI>Create the vbacct.dll by building account.vbp from <A HREF="account.vb/">account.vb</A>.
	<LI>Create an empty package called "Sample Bank" in MTS Explorer and install the
	newly created components (vcacct.dll and vbacct.dll) in the package.  
	<LI>Under Roles create a new role called "Managers".
	<LI>Make vbbank.exe from <A HREF="bank.vb/">bank.vb</A>.
	</OL>

<H5>Monitoring and Running the Sample Bank Application</H5>
<p>To monitor the Sample Bank package components and transactions:</p>
<ol>
<li>For MTS double-click the "Sample Bank" package icon in the right pane of the MTS Explorer.
For COM+ double-click the "The Bank Test Application" package icon in the right pane of the COM Explorer
from within COM+ Applications.
<li>Double-click the Components folder.
<li>On the View menu, click Status View to display usage information for the various components in
the package.
<li>On the Window menu, click New Window. 
<li>Re-arrange the new window so the two windows do not overlap. You can stack different windows by
selecting either the Cascade or Tile Horizontally options from the Window menu.
<li>For MTS click Transaction Statistics in the left pane of the new window.  For COM+ click on the Distributed 
Transaction Coordinator and then click Transaction Statistics.
<li>Right click Transaction Statistics, click View, Console Tree to clear the check mark and
hide the left pane. Now transactions statistics are displayed when transactional components are used.
</ol>
<p>To run the Bank client: </p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is running. Select My Computer
in the left pane of the Transaction Server Explorer. Open the Action menu and click Start MS DTC if
that option is enabled.
<li>Make sure that SQL Server is running. You can start SQL Server from Control Panel.
<li>For MTS run the Bank Client by going to <A HREF="bank.vb/">bank.vb</A> and selecting vbbank.exe.
For COM+ go to Start/Programs/Component Services/VB Bank Client.  Arrange the Bank Client window so
that it does not overlap the MTS or COM Explorer windows.

<li>The form will default to credit $1 to account number 1. Click Submit. You should see a response with the new balance.
<li>Observe the MTS or COM Explorer windows. You will notice that the component usage and transaction statistics windows have been updated.
<li>Experiment with the bank client and observe the statistics using different transaction types, servers, and iterations. 
</ol>

Note that the first transaction takes longer than subsequent transaction for the following reasons:

<ul>
<li>The first transaction is creating the sample bank database tables and inserting temporary records.
<li>Beginning the server process consumes system resources.
<li>Opening database connections for the first time is a costly server operation.
</ul>


<h4>Remarks</h4>
If you are planning to target COM+, in order to run this sample, you will need to install COM+ by running the setup.exe found in the preview directory of the Windows NT5 Beta2 CD.
