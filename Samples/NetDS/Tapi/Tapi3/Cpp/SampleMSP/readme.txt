TAPI 3.0 Sample MSP


Overview:
~~~~~~~~~

SampMSP is a sample TAPI 3.0 MSP (media service provider) that shows how
to use the MSP base classes. It is set up to work with audio using
DirectShow, but it does not implement creation or connection of any
specific transport filters. It is meant as a starting point which can
be expanded to suit a particular type of transport.

The sample is of interest to devlopers of TSPs (telephony service
providers) who want to enable TAPI 3.0 applications to stream media with
their TSPs. A TSP that does not have an acoompanying MSP will be fully
functional for call control but will not support the media streaming
features of TAPI 3.0. Please see the Windows SDK documentation for more
information.

Developers of TAPI 3.0 applications, who are not involved in developing
or updating a TAPI TSP/MSP, will not find this sample to be directly
useful.


The following define and implement the sample MSP address object:
	sampaddr.h
	sampaddr.cpp

The following define and implement the sample MSP call object:
	sampcall.h
	sampcall.cpp

The following define and implement the sample MSP stream object:
	sampstrm.h
	sampstrm.cpp

The following implement the main DLL exports:
	sampmsp.cpp
	sampmsp.def 

The following show how to include the MSP base class header files, etc.:
	common.h
	stdafx.h

The following files declare the necessary info for COM server registration:
	sampmsp.idl
	sampmsp.rgc
	sampmsp.rc
	resource.h
 
How to build the sample:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the sample, set the SDK build environment, then
type "nmake" in the sampmsp directory.  This will build sampmsp.dll.

Note that ATL 2.1 (available with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0) is 
currently needed in order to build this sample (as well as any 
MSP that uses MSP base classes).

How to use the sample:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the Windows SDK documentation for step-by-step
instructions on hooking an MSP into your existing TSP, as well
as information on using the MSP base classes. Don't forget to
assign a unique GUID to your MSP rather than using the GUID that
comes with the sample (see sampmsp.idl).

Once you have made the appropriate modifications to your TSP, you
should be able to make a call using a TAPI 3.0 app (for example, one
of the other samples included in the Windows SDK) and follow the
execution of the SampMSP using the trace output and/or a debugger.
No actual media streaming will occur without modifications to the
sample MSP, as the sample MSP does not know how to access any
specific media transport mechanism (see below).

What functionality does this sample show:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* How to derive a DirectShow-based MSP implementation from the MSP
  base classes
* How to indicate the media types that the MSP supports (in this
  case audio)
* How to keep the number of available streams on a call constant to
  simplify MSP implementation
* How to limit each stream to one selected terminal at a time, to
  simplify MSP implementation
* How to connect and disconnect terminals
* How to control the media streams while keeping track of DirectShow
  graph states, correctly maintaining stream operation across
  terminal selection and unselection, and correctly handling errors
* How to define and implement MSP-TSP communication
* How and when to fire events to the application
* How to catch DirectShow filter graph events, and how to forward them
  to the application

What this sample does not show:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* How to create and connect the transport filters used to implement
  the stream. The procedure for this will vary widely depending on the
  types of filters that the MSP wants to control. Placeholders are
  included to show where to do this.
* How to create new streams or remove existing streams during a call
* How to mix or split the same stream between terminals; i.e., have
  multiple terminals selected on the same stream at the same time
* How to override the terminal implementations (versus standard
  terminal implementations from the  base classes)
* How to expose additional terminals (in addition to standard terminals
  from the base classes)
* How to withhold certain terminals (versus exposing all the standard
  terminals from the base classes)
