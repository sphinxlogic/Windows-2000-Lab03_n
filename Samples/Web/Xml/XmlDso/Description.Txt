Description:
This web page binds data from a data island to HTML elements using the C++ XMLDSO.  There is 
no longer a need for Applet or Object tags, just a simple data island with a src attribute.
Once the data is bound to the HTML, the user can navigate through that data using ADO methods.  The user can add employees by
pressing the "Add Employee" button.  To see the changes that are made to the data set, view
the XML.

Changes made to data through the XMLDSO will be automatically reflected in the XML.  The same
goes for changes made to the XML through the XML Object Model.  This new feature allows the 
user to move back and forth between the XML and ADO object models.  

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or greater on Win32 or Unix platforms to view this demo.
