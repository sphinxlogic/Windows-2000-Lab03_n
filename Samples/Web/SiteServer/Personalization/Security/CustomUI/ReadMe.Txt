INTRODUCTION
-------------
The Customui sample allows you to customize the Sign In user 
interface for each Realm by changing the bitmap that is used
to brand the user interface, and by changing the text that appears on each
screen. This Sign In user interface only appears when you select
DPA as your authorization protocol and Membership security as your
security for the system.

Each Membership System service provider can download a
customized resource DLL to client computers for each Realm it
contains.
