OVERVIEW OF THE WEBDEMO SAMPLE
==============================
Webdemo directory contains five web pages that demonstrate the usage of
the Chat control with Visual Basic Scripting. 

Sample1.htm is a simple chat demo, where the user enters the chat
room path and the nick name and logs onto the chat. 

Sample2.htm is like sample1.htm, but it also demonstrates the usage of no
whisper capability. 

Sample3.htm is a web page, where the user can setup a chat, the chat topic
and the participant count of a chat room. The web page also allows the user
to ignore members, ignore whispers from a member, kick a member out of the 
chat room and get the real name of a participant.

In addition to the functionality that sample3.htm has sample4.htm also 
provides you with an additional IRC server name to logon and gives you
the option to logon anonymously or logon with NTLM authentication for NT
networks.

Sample5.htm is a sample web page, where you can automatically monitor 
a room for words and automatically kick or ban the user if a certain word 
has been used.
