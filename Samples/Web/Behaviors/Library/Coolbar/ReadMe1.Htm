The coolbutton behavior inserts a button into a Web page, as a part of the <b>coolbar</b> behavior.
It provides a visual cue in the form of an icon and/or a text cue in the form a label indicating which action will be performed.
Both the icon and the text can be assigned hover effects for the onmouseout event.
<P>
The coolbutton.htc file can be downloaded from the coolbutton sample page.

The most up to date documentation on the <b>coolbutton</b> behavior can be found on the World Wide Web.
Use Internet Explorer to navigate to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/behaviors/library/behaviorslibrary.asp">behaviors library reference</a>.
