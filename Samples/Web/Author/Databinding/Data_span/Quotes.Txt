' DVD-RAM discs can record only one-hour of moving pictures. Users will find this limited capacity a problem when they try to record two-hour films,' an NEC spokesman said. 
NEC's MMVF format will be able to hold 5.2 gigabytes of information, or two-hours of motion pictures, on a single side, double the 2.6 gigabit capacity of DVD-RAMs and considerably larger than the Sony group's 3.0 gigabits.
