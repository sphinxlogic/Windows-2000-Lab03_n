<title>AFC Setup Autoinstall Documentation</title>

<h1>AFC Setup Autoinstall</h1>

Autoinstall is a useful feature which allows one to run AFC Setup from 
a web page automatically, but only if necessary. The system checks for an 
installed version on the user's hard disk and runs the AFC Setup program only
if necessary.<p>

To use AFC Setup Autoinstall, add the following tag to your HTML page:<p>
<xmp>
<OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:9C06B801-F217-11d0-AA9B-0000F8052E95" 
CODEBASE="afcsetup.exe#Version=1,0,0,2223"
WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0>
</OBJECT>
</xmp>

The <b>OBJECT</b> tag specifies an ActiveX control - here we are using the ActiveX control
registration mechanism for AFC Setup. 
<p>
The <b>CLASSID</b> parameter specifies the GUID
for AFC Setup; this is a unique identifier in the registry which is checked when the page loads.
<p>
<b>CODEBASE</b> is the name of the program to run, followed by a # and a version number.
This version number is compared to the one stored in the registry with the GUID. If the
version on the page is newer, the program is downloaded and run automatically. If the
page's version is older, nothing happens. There is no download unless it is necessary.
<p>
The <B>WIDTH</b> and <b>HEIGHT</b> tags are set to 0 because we don't want any space
on the page allocated for this control.
