   This sample shows how to create a SafeArray in Java,
pass them to a COM server (written in Visual Basic),
and how to inspect a SafeArray returned from a COM server.

   To run the sample, ensure that Visual Basic 5.0 is installed
and that the runtime dll (MSVBVM50.DLL) is in the system path.
Visual Basic 5.0 must be installed in order for the sample to 
run. Change to the directory containing this readme file
and type "run" at the command line.



You should see the output:

   ComputeSum() returned 10

   CreateSquares() returned { 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 }
   Converting results to Java array: { 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 }
