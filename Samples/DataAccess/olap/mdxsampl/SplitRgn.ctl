'* CONTROL: SplitRegion
'*    The SplitRegion control provides a display region that is split between
'*    two controls.  The user can then drag the splitter bar to adjust the size
'*    of the two controls within the SplitRegion.  Similarly, the program can
'*    adjust the split percent to control the size of these two controls.  For
'*    performance reasons the SplitRegion is not a container control.  Instead,
'*    the programmer places the SplitRegion and then sets the FirstControl and
'*    the SecondControl properties to the names of the controls to be displayed
'*    within the SplitRegion.
'*
'* PUBLIC PROPERTIES:
'*    FirstControl               Name of the control to occupy the top or left
'*                               position of the split region (R/W)
'*    SecondControl              Name of the control to occupy the bottom or
'*                               right of the split region (R/W)
'*    FirstControlMinSize        Minimum size of the first control in scale
'*                               units of the container (R/W)
'*    SecondControlMinSize       Minimum size of the second control in scale
'*                               units of the container (R/W)
'*    SplitPercent               Percent of shared region currently occupied by
'*                               first control (R/W)
'*    SplitterBarVertical        True if the splitter bar is vertical, false if
'*                               horizontal (R/W)
'*    SplitterBarThickness       Thickness of the splitter bar in scale units of
'*                               the container (R/W)
'*    SplitterBarColor           Background color of the splitter bar (R/W)
'*    AllowControlHiding         True if a control becomes hidden when its
'*                               portion of the split region is reduced to less
'*                               than the control's minimum size. (R/W)
'*    KeepSplitPercentOnResize   Determines if the split percent is kept or if
'*                               split position is kept during resize (R/W)
'*    RightToLeft                Determines the position of the first and second
'*                               controls when the splitter bar is vertical (for
'*                               bi-directional language compatibility) (R/W)
'*
'* PUBLIC METHODS:
'*    Refresh  Refreshes the display of the SplitRegion. (Call whenever the
'*             SplitRegion has been moved but not resized.)
'*
'* PUBLIC EVENTS:
'*    RepositionSplit   Occurs after the splitter bar is moved

'*******************************************************************************
'* Known issues
'*
'*    Moving the SplitRegion does not generate any events and so will not move
'*    the associated controls until the SplitRegion is resized, the split
'*    percent is changed, or the Refresh method is invoked.
'*
'*    Some controls have a minimum height and width.  Currently SplitRegion
'*    ignores this minimum size which can lead to problems if the split pane
'*    for a control is reduced beyond a control's minimum.  Use the
'*    FirstControlMinSize and SecondControlMinSize properties to prevent this
'*    problem.
'*
'*    Setting the visible property of a SplitRegion in break mode does not
'*    generate the events necessary to show or hide the associated controls.
'*
'*    The SplitRegion control has not been tested in hosts other than VB.  It
'*    will not work directly in IE3.0 due to insufficient support of Extender
'*    objects by IE.  However, a controls containing a SplitRegion control can
'*    work in IE.
