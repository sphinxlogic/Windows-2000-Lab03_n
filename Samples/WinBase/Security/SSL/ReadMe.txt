
SSL WebClient & WebServer

These samples are intended to show one way a developer can implement a 
programmatic solution for secure communication over sockets or other 
transport. These samples make use of the SSL & PCT protocols that are 
implemented by the Security Support Provider (SSP) DLL that ships with 
certain Microsoft Operating Systems. 

Background: SSL & PCT are industry standard protocols and are widely used 
by Web Browsers and Servers to establish secure communication. Products like 
Internet Information Server and Internet Explorer have long made use of the 
SSL & PCT protocols, but the low-level APIs they have used were unavailable 
to the programmer because of Government restrictions on providing uncontrolled
encryption and decryption APIs. Microsoft has solved this problem on Windows 
NT version 4.0 with the release of Service Pack 4, and in all versions of 
Windows 2000, by digitally signing the DLL that implements the SSL & PCT 
protocols (schannel.dll) and forcing all access to schannel.dll to go through 
the "main" security provider DLL, security.dll, which verifies this digital 
signature. Because of this change to the architecture of the SSP interface, 
these samples will not fully work on Windows NT version 4.0 without Service 
Pack 4 or any version of Windows 95/98.

The two main samples provided are meant to demonstrate how the developer can 
code an SSL-enabled replacement for a web server or browser and gain complete 
control over the communication protocol. WebClient and WebServer are 
implemented such that the WebClient will initiate a conversation with the 
WebServer for the purpose of performing a standard HTTP "GET" operation after
performing SSL authentication and key exchange through SSPI.

SSL & PCT are not, however, restricted to use in web browsers and servers. 
The developer can use these protocols to establish trusted and secure 
communication across any communication protocol. The SSPI interface is 
generic, robust and transport independent. For instance, the techniques 
demonstrated here can be easily modified to implement a simple secure data 
exchange over some other IPC method.
