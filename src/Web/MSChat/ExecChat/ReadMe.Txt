OVERVIEW OF THE EXECCHAT SAMPLE
==============================
ExecChat contains a VB application for hosting Executive Chat Sessions. 
This application can be used in three modes: Host, Moderator and Special
Guest.

After building the sample, you can enter a chat session by clicking on the Enter 
Room button. You will need to enter a chat server, room name and alias name in the 
Enter Room dialog box. 

This is a chat tool that is very useful for special guest chats. The sample is setup
so that the Host gets all the questions from the users, while the special guest and
the moderator do not see the questions posted. The host can then send the selected
question to the host with the whisper function and the moderator can then send 
the question to the special guest and the users.

BUILDING THE EXECCHAT SAMPLE
===========================

The execchat sample can be built with Visual Basic 4.0. 

1. Select the Open project command from the File menu.

2. Open the execc.vbp file and build the application.
