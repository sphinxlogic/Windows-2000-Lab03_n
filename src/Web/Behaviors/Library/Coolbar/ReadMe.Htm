<i>This document describes technologies available in Internet Explorer 5.

<P>
The coolbar behavior inserts a toolbar into a Web page, populated with coolbuttons.
Toolbars are a familiar interface for users.
The coolbar behavior applies effects (3D border, colored text, colored image) and supports ToolTips to bring each button to life. 
Using form controls within the coolbar is not recommended because the mouse events captured for the coolbar behavior may interfere with access to the form controls. 
<P>
The coolbar.htc file can be downloaded from the coolbar sample page.
<P>
The most up to date documentation on the <b>coolbar</b> behavior can be found on the World Wide Web.
Use Internet Explorer to navigate to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/behaviors/library/behaviorslibrary.asp">behaviors library reference</a>.
