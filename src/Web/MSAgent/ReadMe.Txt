Microsoft® Agent supports the presentation of software agents as interactive personalities within the Microsoft Windows® interface. Microsoft® Agent comes with a cast of three characters: Merlin, Genie, and Robby. You can use these characters as interactive assistants to introduce, guide, entertain, or otherwise enhance Web pages or applications. Microsoft® Agent also includes tools for defining custom characters. 

Each sample includes a Readme.txt file with further instructions for building and running the sample. The instructions assume that you are using Microsoft Visual Basic®, Microsoft Visual C++®, or Microsoft Visual J++, as appropriate.
