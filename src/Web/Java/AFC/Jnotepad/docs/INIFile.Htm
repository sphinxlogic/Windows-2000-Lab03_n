JNotepad is a highly customizable program; it was designed for expandability in mind. The
core of its customization is the JNOTEPAD.INI file. This allows you to set colors and settings
for the application.<p>

JNotepad tries to read the JNOTEPAD.INI file upon startup. If it does not exist, an internal
set of settings is used instead. The JNOTEPAD.INI file is written when the program exits. 
This allows you to obtain a clean default JNOTEPAD.INI simply by erasing the current
JNOTEPAD.INI and running JNotepad.<p>

JNOTEPAD.INI has a format very similar to Windows INI files. There are several section names,
enclosed in brackets, containing key-value pairs. All values are case sensative. A sample section may look like:<br>
<xmp>
[Colors]
Bright Green=0 255 0
Yellow=255 255 0
Bright Red=255 0 0
Red=128 0 0
</xmp>

Each line contains a key associated with a value. For example, Yellow is associated with the string "255 255 0". All
keys and values are strings.<p>

JNotepad contains several sections:<p>

<h3>[Colors]</h3>
Defines colors for the JNotepad system. Each key in this section is the name of a color,
and each value is the RGB definition for it. Each field in the RGB definition is separated 
by a space. <br>
<i>Example:</i>
<xmp>
Blue=0 0 128
</xmp>
Blue is associated with the RGB value 0 0 128 (0 red, 0 green 128 blue).
<br>
Color names are used in other sections of the INI file.

<p>
<h3>[Accelerators]</h3>
Defines accelerator keys. These keys are shortcut keys for menu and toolbar commands in 
JNotepad. Each key is the name of the accelerator key and the menu command it will perform. 
Example:
<xmp>
ctrl-s=Save
</xmp>
Ctrl-S is the shortcut key, and it runs the command Save. The section key must start with 
<i>ctrl</i> and be followed by the key to act as the accelerator. The command to run must
be identical to the name of the menu item which runs it. <p>

Control keys must be a single character. The only exception is the TAB key, which must be
spelled out:
<xmp>
ctrl-tab=Next Window
</xmp>

Control-shift key combinations are also supported using the <i>ctrlshift</i> keyword:
<xmp>
ctrlshift-tab=Previous Window
</xmp>

<h3>[Toolbar]</h3>
The toolbar section allows you to customize the toolbar. All keys in this section start
with a number, which corresponds to the position of the button in the
toolbar. 0 is the leftmost button. Each key has a value which identifies
what command is executed when that button is pressed. This string identifies a
separate section in the INI file which describes the command. A sample
[Toolbar] entry looks like this:<br>
<xmp>
[Toolbar]
0=CMD_New
1=CMD_Cut
</xmp>
This key identifies the leftmost toolbar button, button 0, as having the
command described by the section [CMD_New], and a button in position 1
which has the command CMD_Cut.<p>

The sections that describe commands look similar to:<br>
<xmp>
[CMD_New]
Image=Images\new.gif
CMD=4021
Tip=101
</xmp>
The <i>Image</i> key identifies the relative path of the GIF used on the
toolbar button. The <i>CMD</i> key specifies the menu ID of the command
which the toolbar button will activate. The <i>Tip</i> key contains the
string ID number of the text on the tooltip. The menu ID and string ID 
numbers refer to values found in the jnotepad.res resource file's Menu 
section and String table section, respectively.
<p>

<h3>File Format Sections</h3>
JNotepad allows customization by file type. This is done by including a section in the
INF containing the extension of the file type. This section name must be in all uppercase.
Example:<br>
<xmp>
[JAVA]
</xmp>
corresponds to .java files. <br>
<xmp>
[TXT]
</xmp>
corresponds to .txt files. A special section named <b>[DEFAULT]</b> stores settings for
files that are created in JNotepad.<p>

These sections can have one of two keys:<p>
<b>Foreground</b><br>
Specifies the foreground color. This is the name of a color from the <b>[Colors]</b> section.<br>
<b>Background</b><br>
Specifies the background color. This is the name of a color from the <b>[Colors]</b> section.<br>
<p>
For example:
<xmp>
[JAVA]
Foreground=White
Background=Blue
</xmp>
sets the foreground color of .java files to White and the background color to Blue. These
colors must have been defined in a [Colors] section.<p>
