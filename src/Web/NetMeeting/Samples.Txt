OVERVIEW OF THE NETMEETING SDK SAMPLES
======================================

The Samples directory consists of the following subdirectories, which  
contain samples demonstrating the use of the NetMeeting ActiveX Control,
NetMeeting COM objects, Internet Locator COM Objects, and Codec
installation COM Objects.

To build the samples from Visual C++, open the project makefile 
(for example, sample.mak) as a Microsoft VC++ project, and build as usual.
The NetMeeting SDK directories must be added to your VC++ environment
(use the Directories tab under the Tools->Options menu item).


NMCHAT
------
NMCHAT is a simple chat application that demonstrates the use of the new
NetMeeting 2.1 INm* COM interfaces.  In particular, this sample illustrates
the use of data channels to transmit information to peer applications in
a NetMeeting conference, as well as the basics of detecting new calls and
joining those calls.



NMUI
----
NMUI is a large sample that demonstrates the use of most of the new COM
interfaces.  A critical new feature demonstrated by NMUI is the ability
for an application to replace NetMeeting's User Interface.

In general you enable this sample to start its work by selecting the File,
Monitor menu item.  This kicks off the sample's processing.

Using this sample you can see how to replace NetMeeting's user interface
with that of your own application.   To see this, go to the View,Options...
dialog and select the NM_INIT_CONTROL *before* selecting Monitor.  This will
cause the NMUI sample, via the NetMeeting 2.1 API, to "take over" all UI from
NetMeeting.  Upon selecting Monitor, the NetMeeting UI will not appear and
you can drive everything from within the NMUI sample.

You can use the Call, User... menu to place calls, the Channel, Application
Sharing... menu to manipulate shared applications, The Call, Accept... menu
item to accept incoming calls, etc.



SKIPPY
------
SKIPPY demonstrates the use of the ILS COM interface to gain access to
the same LDAP directory services used in NetMeeting.  SKIPPY shows how to
register with a server, retrieve information from a server, and filter that
information for specific properties or content.

See SKIPPY.TXT in the SKIPPY directory for more information.


INSTCODC
--------
INSTCODC demonstrates the use of the codec installation APIs in NetMeeting
2.1.  These APIs are of interest only to vendors of audio and video codecs
who wish to add their codec to the set of codecs available during NetMeeting
calls.

See INSTCODC.TXT in the INSTCODC directory for more information.


AVPHONE
-------
The AVPHONE sample demonstrates the use of the audio & video API 
built into NetMeeting.  It shows how to establish an A/V call and 
manipulate the video display.

See the AVPHONE.TXT file in the HTML directory for more information.


VBCARD
------
VBCARD is a data conferencing application that leverages the AcitveX Control.

See the VBCARD.TXT file in the VBCARD directory for more information.


NMSHARE
-------
The NMSHARE directory contains a sample which demonstrates the application
sharing interfaces in the NetMeeting 2.1 COM API.  NMSHARE is particularly
focused on new app sharing state notifications built into the new 2.1 COM APIs.
Run NMSHARE, establish a call with NetMeeting, share an app using NetMeeting,
and watch the various state changes as they are tracked in NMSHARE.  You can use
the Share menu to set the collaboration state of application sharing.

See the NMSHARE.TXT file in the NMSHARE directory for more information.


NMFT
----
The NMFT directory contains a sample which demonstrates the file transfer
related interfaces in the NetMeeting 2.1 COM API.

To run the NMFT application you must already be in a NetMeeting call.
Once in a call, running the application will result in a "pick a file" dialog
box that allows you to choose the file to send.  A progress indicator is
displayed during the send.

See the NMFT.TXT file in the NMFT directory for more information.
