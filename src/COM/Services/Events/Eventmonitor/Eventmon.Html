<P>      This sample 
introduces the COM+ EventSystem aka Loosely Coupled Events. This sample shows how 
to build EventClasses, Subscriptions, PublisherFilter and also how to&nbsp;fire 
Events using them.</P>

<P>The events of our interest happening are dispatched using COM+ EventSystem to 
the registered subscribers. These are the following events we simulate and 
dispatch through COM+ EventSystem,</P>

<P>          
    - DiskFull event when the the diskspace 
hits a threshold value</P>

<P>      - FileCreated, FileDeleted, 
FileRemoved, FileUpdated events from the FileSystem</P>

<P>     - ProcessCreated, ProcessTerminated and 
PNPDeviceAdded from the Operating System</P>

<P><STRONG>"EventMonitor" </STRONG>consists of four 
programs, <STRONG>EventMonPublisher</STRONG>, a publisher application that 
publishes these events, <STRONG>EventMonEventClass</STRONG>, an EventClass dll, 
<STRONG>EventMonFilter</STRONG>, a publisher filter and 
<STRONG>EventMonSubscriber</STRONG>       
         
        
          
           
           
         
         
        , a subscriber 
for these events.</P>

<P>       
         
        
          
           
           
   EventMonPublisher.exe is a dialog based application 
to administer the the EventMonitor system. It does registration/unregistration 
of EventClasses and Subscription. This can also be used to simulate 
firing of events.</P>

<P>       
         
        
          
           
           
         
         
    EventMonEventClass.dll is registered as a COM+ configured 
component, using EventMonEventPublisher.</P>

<P>       
         
        
          
           
           
         
 EventMonFilter.dll is a COM server which implements all 
necessary interfaces and methods to act as&nbsp;a PublisherFilter for all the 
above mentioned interfaces/methods.</P>

<P>       
         
        
          
           
           
         
       EventMonSubscriber is 
also registered as a COM+ configured component, using EventMonPublisher, which acts 
as the subscriber.</P>

SAMPLE</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P>Open the workspace <FONT color=red>EventMonitor.dsw </FONT>in 
the VC++6.0. Make sure that <b>"EventMonPublisher Classes"</b> is set as the active project. Press F7. This builds the following four projects.</P>

<P><EM>EventMonPublisher.dsp,&nbsp;EventMonEventClass.dsp, 
EventMonFilter.dsp, EventMonSubscriber.dsp.</EM> The output files are 
EventMonPublisher.exe, EventMonEventClass.dll, EventMonFilter.dll, EventMonSubscriber.dll. By default, the build 
process, registers all the three dlls. (You can also register these three dlls 
using regsvr32.ex from your system32 directory)</P>

<P><U>EventMonPublisher</U></P>

<P>This is a dialog based application. This dialog is used 
to administer EventMonitor. EventClasses and Subscriptions are registered using ths UI, 
which makes use of COM+ Admin APIs. This UI is also used 
to fire events.</P>

<P><U>EventMonEventClass</U></P>

<P>This is a COM+ configured component which exports 
DllRegisterServer, DllUnregisterServer, DllCanUnloadNow, DllGetClassObject<FONT 
color=red>.&nbsp; [Note</FONT><FONT color=red>: Only DllUnregisterServer needs 
to have an implementation and other exported API's can just return a S_OK. Also 
this dll doesn't need to implement the firing interfaces]. </FONT><FONT 
color=black>The CLSID and the ProgID of this component is used as EventClassID 
and EventClassName of the EventMonEventClass</FONT>         
           
            
     </P>

<P><U>EventMonFilter</U></P>

<P>This is the PublisherFilter, a COM server, that can be 
set declaratively (when a EventClass is registerd )as well as during 
runtime(when a EventClass is instantiated). This is used&nbsp;alongwith the 
EventClass. This component&nbsp;implements interfaces IDiskEvents, IFileSystemEvents, ISystemEvents, and 
IMultiInterfacePublisherFilter</P>

<P><U>EventMonSubscriber</U></P>

<P>Subscriber of the events. This is also a COM+ 
configured component. This component implements the following interfaces IDiskEvents, 
IFileSystemEvents and ISystemEvents.</P>

<P><FONT 
size=5><U><STRONG>OPERATION</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P>  - Make sure EventMonFilter.dll is 
registered. </P>

<P>- Launch EventMonPublisher.exe. On its startup, 
EventMonPublisher.exe creates two application one called EventMonPublisherApp and the 
other called EventMonSubscriberApp. It also installs the EventMonSubscriber component 
under the EventMonSubscriberApp. </P>

<P><FONT color=red>[Note: Please don't execute these steps 
for the currnet sample. EventMonPublisherApp and EventMonSubscriberApp are created using 
COM+Admin APIs. The steps are provided here for general help]</FONT></P>

<P>- Right click COM+ Applications and select 
New=&gt;Application</P>

<P>- Click on "Create Empty Application" button and press 
Next.</P>

<P>- Choose whichever activation model you want and also 
enter a Name for this applicaion</P>

<LI>In the "EventClass" group box, check the "PublisherID" and the "AllowInprocActivation" checkboxes then click the "Register" button. 
  

<LI>If the registration is successful, the text on the 
  "Register" button would have changed to"Unregister"</LI></UL>

<P> This creates a "EventClass" component under 
the EventMonPublisherApp application. This makes use 
of ICOMAdminCatalog::InstallEventClass(....) to install a "EventClass" under 
the EventMonPublisherApp application. [Note: Thorough this procedure, we've 
just defined the meta-data of our eventclass. The implementation of the EventClass 
is provided by the COM+ EventSystem based on the meta-data]. The 
InstallEventClass( ) function which we discussed above takes the EventClass dll path name and the path of the typelibrary 
name. The typelibrary specifies all the 
interfaces that are to be implemented by this 
EventClass component.</P>
<P>Note: The EventClass dll in this project is created using ATL wizard. The 
wizard generates a coclass by default which is not required for EventClass 
registration. Since the wizard the coclass by default, the class is retained and 
does not have any implementation. But this dll does have DllRegisterServer 
implementation and dummy implementation for other exports and this dll also 
contains the tlb file that firing interface details. You could choose any tool 
to write a dll that does this. Though this dll gets registered as the COM server 
implementation for this EventClass object (CLSID) in the registry, in reality 
when an EventClass object is instantiated using COM activation APIs, the runtime 
interprets the call and loads an eventsystem provided dll instead.</P>

<P> A subscription cannot have both EventClassID 
and PublisherID property set. Also, a subscription cannot have all the following 
properties EventClassID, PublisherID and InterfaceID set to be NULL. A 
subscription will be called when the following criteria is met,</P>

<P>- If only EventClassID is set, then this subscription 
can be called from different publishers who can instantiate this eventclass and make 
a method call on it (provided the method matches)</P>

subscription can be called for all eventclasses having that PublisherID 
(provided the method matches)</P>

PublisherID should be set in this case), then all method calls for all the 
interfaces (implemented by the eventclass) will be called provided the component

<P>You should see a same message box but this time from a 
transient subscriber.</P>

<P><FONT color=red>[NOTE: Transient subscription cannot be 
created using the COM+ Services Snapin. It can be created only through COM+ 
Admin APIs]</FONT></P>

<P><U><EM><STRONG>Step #5 Parameterized Filtering</STRONG></EM></U></P>

<P>Instead of setting up a separate publisher filter, for 
all simple straightforward filtering we can go for parameterized filtering. This 
is associated with the subscription.</P>

<UL>
<LI>In the "Subscription" group box, click the "UnRegister" button
<LI>Check the "Filter Criteria" checkbox
<LI>Click the "Register" button
<LI>In the "Firing" group box, in the "Interface" dropdown box select the "IDiskEvents"
<LI>In the "Method" dropdown box select "DiskFull"
<LI>In the "Method Argument" textbox type "Dummy"
<LI>Click the "Fire" button
</LI></UL>

<p>
[When FilterCriteria is set, COM+ EventSystem, before firing the 
subscription evaluates the FilterCriteria and decides if the subscription needs 
to be fired or not]. Now, you should see a messagebox. Now change the argument 
to "Smart" and then click on Fire. You shouldn't get a message box.
