<h2>Object Synchronization Time Comparison</h2>

<h4>COM+ Synchronization Overview</h4>
<P>COM+ provides synchronization from component to component when called from a multi-threaded client
without the complexity of writing a free-threaded object. By setting the synchronization attribute for
a component you can let the COM+ Services handle the component synchronization. You can read more about
COM+ synchronization in the Platform SDK under COM+ (Component Services), Concurrency. </p>
<h5>Sample Overview</h5>
<p>The SyncComp sample shows the time performance of the COM+ Synchronization service 
in relation to the other models, Single Threaded Apartment and Free Threaded Apartment. This sample
comprises of a host which creates either a Single Threaded Apartment object, a Free Threaded
Apartment object or a COM+ Synchronized object and then creates multiple threads to call the
created object multiple times. The elapsed time required to call each type of object is recorded and averaged.

This sample shows that a COM+ Synchronized object is slightly slower than a Free Threaded object
but faster than an Apartment Threaded object. This shows that you get almost the same speed benefit of a 
free-threaded object while maintaining the simplicity of writing single threaded objects.</p>

<h4>Build Notes</h4>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Build the SyncComp client and the three objects by opening the 
SyncComp.DSW workspace from Visual C++, set <b>"SyncComp Classes"</b> as the active project, then build by pressing the <b>"F7"</b> key. <SMALL><I>You can 
also use the Microsoft NMAKE-compatible makefile (MAKEFILE).</I></SMALL> 
<p>
<LI>Create a new empty COM+ Server Application called STA Object.
<LI>Add the STAObject.DLL as a new component to the application. 
<LI>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the STAObject component 
un-check the <B>Enable Just In Time Activation</B> option.
<LI>On the <B>Concurency</B> tab set the <B>Synchronization support</B> to <B>Not Supported</B>. 
<LI>All other property defaults are acceptable </LI>
<p>
<LI>Create a new empty COM+ Server Application called Free Object.
<LI>Add the FreeObject.DLL as a new component to the application. 
<LI>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the FreeObject component 
un-check the <B>Enable Just In Time Activation</B> option.
<LI>On the <B>Concurency</B> tab set the <B>Synchronization support</B> to <B>Not Supported</B>. 
<LI>All other property defaults are acceptable </LI>
<p>
<LI>Create a new empty COM+ Server Application called ComSync Object.
<LI>Add the ComSyncObject.DLL as a new component to the application. 
<LI>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the ComSyncObject component 
un-check the <B>Enable Just In Time Activation</B> option.
<LI>On the <B>Concurency</B> tab set the <B>Synchronization support</B> to <I><B>Required</B></I>. 
<LI>All other property defaults are acceptable </LI>
</OL>
</p>
<H4>Run Notes</H4>
<P>To run this sample 
<UL>
<LI>Start the client program (SyncComp.EXE). 
<LI>Change the number of threads and/or the number of iterations to desired levels.
<LI>Make sure the radio button next to STA is selected.
<LI>Press the start button to run the tests. The results will be recorded in the text boxes to the right
of the radio button.
<LI>Select the radio button next to Free-Threaded and press the start button. Let the tests finish.
<LI>Select the radio button next to the COM+ Sync and press the start button. Let the tests finish.
</UL>
Note that the COM+ times are only slightly slower then the free-threaded mode but faster than the STA mode.
<I>You might need to adjust the number of threads or the iterations (or both) to see meaningfull results.</I>
</P>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<P>Another benefit of COM+ synchronization is that it
can nest synchronization domains. To explain this concept imagine a series of
objects (O1, O2, O3) that can be called directly by the client or can be called
by each other. Since the objects can be called by the client each object must
be able to execute in a synchronized domain. In a free-threaded model each
object would create it's own synchronization. So, in the case where the client
calls O1, O1 calls O2, and then O2 calls O3, there will be three synchronization
objects created (one for each object being called). However, if these objects
where marked as COM+ Synchronized objects (written without the synchronization
code) and the same example is run: client calls O1, O1 calls O2, and then O2
calls O3. Only one synchronization object will be created. This is because when
O1 calls O2 COM+ recognizes that the call is already in a synchronization
domain. So, COM+ doesn't need to create another synchronization object. The
same is true when O2 calls O3.
