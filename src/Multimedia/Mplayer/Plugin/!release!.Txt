Note: These samples were codebased in advance of the RTM release of NetShow 3.0

The Pre-RTM codebase is reflected in the <OBJECT> tag of all of these samples.  

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you are attempting to view these samples after the RTM release, you
will want to change the codebase to the RTM code so that the correct version
of the Media Player will be auto-sensed downloaded to the user's browser.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To do this, locate the following statement in the <EMBED> tag:
codebase="http://www.microsoft.com/netshow/download/en/nsmp2inf.cab#Version=5,1,51,415"

and replace it with:
codebase="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/netshow/download/en/nsmp2inf.cab#Version=5,1,52,701"
