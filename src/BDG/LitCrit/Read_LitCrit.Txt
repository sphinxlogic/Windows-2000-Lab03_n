1. What are the Corporate Media Library and LitCrit?
----------------------------------------------------
The Corporate Media Library (CML) and LitCrit are sample
three-tier applications that illustrate programming techniques
for the Windows DNA programming model and show how to use
multiple Microsoft BackOffice Server products together.

The document written to accompany the CML and LitCrit is
the BackOffice Developer's Guide (BDG). The BDG helps you
develop distributed applications using a combination of
Microsoft BackOffice Server products. 

You can download both the BDG document and its sample
applications from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/bdg.asp.

The application download includes all source code for the
sample applications and the supporting files you need to run
them. The BDG documentation fully explains the steps you take
to build and install the applications.

You can also view the BDG document on the Internet at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ under the
Platform SDK, Design Strategies and Standards heading.
