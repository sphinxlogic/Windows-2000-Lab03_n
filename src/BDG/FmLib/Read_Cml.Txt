1. What is the Corporate Media Library?
---------------------------------------
The Corporate Media Library (CML) sample application is a
three-tier application that illustrates programming techniques
for the Windows DNA programming model and shows how to use
multiple Microsoft BackOffice Server products together in one
application. 

The document written to accompany the Corporate Media Library
sample application is the BackOffice Developer's Guide (BDG). 
The BDG helps you develop distributed applications using a
combination of Microsoft BackOffice Server products. 

You can download both the BDG document and the CML application
from http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/bdg.asp.

The application download includes all source code for the CML 
application and the supporting files you need to run it. The BDG 
documentation fully explains the steps you take to build and install
the application.

You can also view the BDG document on the Internet at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ under the
Platform SDK, Design Strategies and Standards heading.
