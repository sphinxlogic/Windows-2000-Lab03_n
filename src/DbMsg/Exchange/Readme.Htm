<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>This file contains late-breaking information about issues you may encounter when
building or using the Microsoft Exchange Server libraries and samples that accompany the
Platform SDK in the Database and Messaging component. </p>
<p>Issues are organized under the following broad categories:
<ul>
<li><a href="#library">Library and COM Component Issues</a><br>
   Issues related to the COM components or the ExchSDK.lib library.</li>
<li><a href="#samples">Samples Issues</a><br>
   Issues related to the samples themselves.</li>
<li><a href="#misc">Miscellaneous Issues</a><br>
   Any other issues.</li>
</ul>
The samples are listed in the following sections according the
convention used in the documentation:  the name of the sample matches the
directory name in which the sample resides. This convention also applies to the library and components.  
</p>
<h3><a name="library"></a>Library and COM Component Issues</h3>

<h4>Compiling COM Components using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0</h4>
<ul><li>The new COM components <b>ACL</b>, <b>Rule</b>, and <b>AcctMgmt</b>
        are based on the Active Template Library (ATL). If you build one of the new COM components
        on one machine with the MinSize configuration, and then copy and register the component on
        a separate server machine, that machine will also require the new 3.0 version of the
        Active Template Library (ATL) dynamic link library ATL.DLL for the component to function
        properly. This run-time library is installed with the new Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0
        release.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Building Administrative Extensions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you build the administrative extensions using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
      with the NDEBUG flag set, you must ensure that the MFC42.DLL, MFC42D.DLL, MSVCRT.DLL, and
      MSVCRTD.DLL dynamic link libraries are in the link path. If these files are not in the
      linker's path, a link error occurs.
  </li>
  <li>If you build the administrative extensions using Visual C++ 6.0 and want to run the
      sample on a machine that does not have Visual C++ 6.0 installed, you must copy the
      MFC42.DLL, MFC42D.DLL and MSVCRTD.DLL libraries to the System32 directory on the machine
      running the sample.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compiler Produces Warning Messages</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>The compiler can produce warning messages when building the samples.
	  You can safely ignore these warnings.
	  </li>
    </ul>

<h4>AcctMgmt Component</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This component does not check for invalid information supplied to create new accounts.
        Invalid information includes group
        names containing invalid characters, passwords longer than the maximum length, and
        usernames containing periods or spaces.</li>
    <li>The <strong>ChangeOwnerOfSecDescriptor</strong> method does not check whether the passed in 
        <em>OldOwner</em> parameter is part of the security descriptor.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>ACLObject Component</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are not the Exchange Server administrator, you must logon to a MAPI session before
        creating the ACL Object.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Rule Component</h4>
 <ul>
      <li>The Information Store accepts a maximum of 32K bytes of rule logic on a folder. This
        limit translates to approximately 200 simple rules on a folder.</li>
      <li>The <b>Rules.Item</b> property must be explicitly cast to an integer
        when using scripting languages such as VBScript.
        For example, <code><pre>myRule = objRules.Item(CInt(num))
		  </code></pre></li>
      <li>The <b>Actions.Add</b> method always adds actions to the end of the
        collection.</li>
      <li>The <b>Action.Arg</b> property does not accept Unicode characters.
        It instead substitutes the <strong>?</strong> character in place of each Unicode character.</li>
      <li>The <b>SizeCondition.Size</b> property erroneously allows negative values to be set.</li>
    </ul>
<h3><a name="samples"></a>Sample Issues</h3>

<h4>ACLASP Sample</h4>
<ul>
<li>Searching (using the Find button in the sample) the Recipients
 directory container using one character, such as 'n', 's', or 'x', can return unexpected
   results (depending on your set of installed proxy addresses), such as &quot;SMTP&quot;, &quot;X400&quot;,
   &quot;NOTES&quot;, in the list of display names, aliases, and
	proxy addresses.  This problem occurs during Ambiguous Name Resolution
	(ANR) searches using a CDO filter. To avoid this problem, submit a query using as
	many letters as possible. 
</li>
 <li>Searches (using the Find button in the sample) of the Recipients directory container will
 not find members if their respective alias and display name
 both contain a leading space.  For example, if you have a distribution list with alias and
 display name both equal to &quot; Admins&quot; (i.e. space - Admins), it will never appear as a result of a search.
 </li>

</ul>
<h4>AEditor Sample</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The editor terminates abnormally when the Routing Wizard dynamic link library is not
	installed. To avoid this problem, install the Routing Wizard dynamic link library (Exrtobj.dll)
	 from Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1.</li>
	<li>If you use the Exchange Administrator program to delete a mailbox used by a profile
		that is
        in the list of previously viewed profiles, and then try to access the profile in the
        sample, an error with the message
		&quot;Method 'Session' of object 'IEvents' failed&quot; is generated.</li>
	<li>The sample neither displays nor allows you to modify custom agents.</li>
	<li>The sample does not check whether folder permissions are changed after setting the
        folder. If the permissions on a folder are changed you must restart the sample to pick up the
        changes.</li>
    <li>The sample does not gracefully degrade when the environment changes radically,
        such as when the network is unreachable or the information store has stopped.</li>
	<li>The sample allows concurrent access to a folder.
        <br>
        If user A opens a folder to add a new agent, and before they save the new agent User B also
        opens the folder, both users can save their agent to the folder.
        The result is two agents available in the selected folder, with two different scripts.
        The map will be whichever was the last one saved.
        <br>
        One possible solution this problem is to give only one user permission to create agents on a
        folder.</li>
	<li>The sample erroneously allows you to create an agent on the Calendar folder.</li>
</ul>
<h4>DLUpdate Sample</h4>
<ul>
      <li>This sample only searches the top-level Recipients container for entries. 
        If you have multiple Recipients directory containers and you
        want to search them all, you must modify the sample code.
		</li>
      <li>You can create an illegal directory name using a client that supports 
        Unicode characters by entering them in the alias field.
        To avoid this problem, do not enter Unicode characters in the alias field.</li>
      <li>The sample does not correctly display non-Roman characters in the name of a distribution list.
        Each non-Roman character erroneously appears as the '?' character .</li>
      <li>In the file Constants.inc, the result-set size for ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) queries is
	  set to 100 using the mcADS_RS_PAGE_SIZE constant.  This matches the number supported for the
      default Exchange Server 5.5
	  LDAP configuration.  If you increase this value in the sample to over 100, make sure to
	  update the LDAP search configuration value on the Exchange Server to match or exceed
	  the new value.
	   If this is not done, the sample will generate an error with the message
	  &quot;The name limit for the local computer network adapter card
        was exceeded&quot; if the size of the query result set is larger than the LDAP setting.
		The LDAP search result-set size can
		be modified throught the Exchange Adminstrator application:
		navigate to
		the property page located at Configuration,
        Protocols, LDAP (Directory) Site Defaults, Search, and update the "Ma<u>x</u>imum number of search results returned" to the desired value.</li>
      <li>The sample generates an error if you change the search parameter while the sample is
        returning the query results.
        To avoid this problem, wait until the sample has completed refreshing the query results
        before changing the search parameter.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Gateway Sample</h4>
<ul>
      <li>The sample does not accept data from a DAT file that was produced with the
	  CFGCODE sample executable and a custom INI file.</li>
      <li>If you want to build the binary, you must edit the INF file to ensure the file size and
        date entry for each file is correct.</li>
      <li>The sample exits when it receives a <strong>MAPI_E_NETWORK_ERROR</strong> error when
        polling for new messages.</li>
      <li>The sample can create an unusable address if the organization or site name contains a space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Incremental Change Synchronization (ICS) Visual Studio Wizard Sample</h4>
<ul>
      <li>Building with the MFC library as a statically linked library produces a C++ run-time
        library conflict while linking.<br>
        To avoid this problem, always build with the MFC library as a shared DLL.</li>
      <li>The compiler can produce warning messages when building the samples.&nbsp; To disable
        the warnings, you can add certain libraries to the project's Link Ingore list.<br>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Debug Configuration</em> - You can safely ignore warnings about links to MSCVRT.LIB
            (Microsoft C runtime libraries) or add it to the Ignore list.&nbsp; If you encounter link
            errors to the MSVCRTD.LIB (Debug version of the C runtime), make sure this library is in
            your link path as this library should be linked property for the debug configuration.<br>
          </li>
          <li><em>Release Configuration</em> -&nbsp; You can add LIBC.LIB and MSVCRTD.LIB to the
            Project, Settings, Link, Input, Ignore libraries field in Visual C++.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The ICS NT service fails to start after service is installed.<br>
          To alleviate this problem, copy Folder_EIDS.sav from the source directory into the directory
          containing ICSAgentNTService.awx.
</ul>

<h4>Instform Sample</h4>
<ul>
      <li>This form installation sample is not supported on Alpha machines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mailbox Sample</h4>
 <ul>
      <li>You can create an illegal mailbox name using a client that accepts double-byte (Unicode)
        characters by entering double-byte characters in the alias field.<br>
        To avoid this problem, do not enter double-byte characters in the alias field.</li>
      <li>You can accidently try to add the same mailbox twice.<br>
        If you click the <strong>Submit</strong> button twice on the <em>Add Mailbox</em> page,
        the sample reports a <em>Recipient is already on file</em> error. The sample does not
        report that a mailbox is successfully added after the first click.</li>
      <li>You cannot access an Exchange server on a remote computer if NT challenge and response
        security is used for authentication.</li>
      <li>The sample allows you to create an illegal NT account, such as an account with periods
        or spaces in the account name.</li>
      <li>You can use this sample to only search the top-level container for entries. 
        If you have multiple <em><strong>Recipients</strong></em> directory containers and you
        want the sample to search them all, you must modify the code. </li>
</ul>
<h4>RuleASP Sample</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Searching (using the Find button in the sample) the Recipients
   directory container using one character, such as 'n', 's', or 'x', can return unexpected
   results (depending on your set of installed proxy addresses), such as &quot;SMTP&quot;, &quot;X400&quot;,
   &quot;NOTES&quot;, in the list of display names, aliases, and
	proxy addresses.  This problem occurs during Ambiguous Name Resolution
	(ANR) searches using a CDO filter. To avoid this problem, submit a query using as
	many letters as possible. 
 </li>
 <li>Searches (using the Find button in the sample) of the Recipients directory container will
 not find senders or recipients if their respective alias and display name
 both contain a leading space.  For example, if you have a distribution list with alias and
 display name both equal to &quot; Admins&quot;, it will never appear as a result of a search.
 </li>
 <li>The &quot;Delete&quot; action for a rule deletes the message rather than moves the
        message to the &quot;Deleted Items&quot; folder.
        This is by design for the sample. If you want to change this behavior to move the message
        to the &quot;Deleted Items&quot; folder, change the action from delete to move, and set
        the <em>Action</em><strong>.Arg</strong> property to the &quot;Deleted Items&quot; folder
        (see the <strong>Action</strong>
        class example).</li>
  <li>The sample cannot search mailboxes with leading spaces.</li>
  <li>The sample will not allow you to log on to a mailbox using a different character set
        than the one used to create the mailbox alias.</li>
  <li>If a public folder does not have owner permissions, you cannot update more than one
        rule.</li>
  <li>If you create a folder rule without a condition, the sample cannot display the rules on that
      folder.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>TOOLFORM Sample</h4>
<ul><li>This sample is only supported for use with the Microsoft Exchange client.
The form does not function properly with any version of Microsoft Outlook.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Issues</h3>

<h4>RECIPIENTINFO Structure</h4>
<ul>
      <li>If you do not supply a last name in the <strong>pszLastName</strong> member, the proxy
        generator uses the common name member, <strong>pszCommonName</strong>, not the first name
        member, <strong>pszFirstName</strong>.
        This can result in an erroneous proxy address.</li>
</ul>
