OVERVIEW OF THE ILSINST.EXE
===========================
The REDISTRB directory contains ILSINST.EXE.  This is a self-extracting
executable that installs WLDAP32.DLL and ILS.DLL.  ILSINST.EXE is provided
for two purposes:

1.  Developers who do not need the rest of the NetMeeting APIs can install
support for the ILS APIs without installing the rest of NetMeeting.

2.  ISVs interested in leveraging the ILS APIs without the rest of the
NetMeeting APIs, can ship and execute ILSINST.EXE as a part of their setup
procedure.  This will result in correctly installed versions of the necessary
DLLs on the customers machine.

USING ILSINST.EXE
=====================
ILSINST.EXE can be run in two ways: with UI feedback and without it.

With UI feedback:  Simply executing the sample will prompt the end-user with
typical setup language - "Do you want to install ILS support?", etc.   This
mode will typically be leveraged by developers who are simply looking to install
ILS support on their machines without installing NetMeeting.

Without UI feedback:  If you execute the sample with a command line switch - /Q -
then no user interface will be presented as a result of running the executable.
This mode is intended to be used during the setup procedure for your application.
If you don't want the standard Microsoft UI to appear, you can use this switch to
force no UI to appear.

The self-extracting executable installs two files to the users machine: 
ils.dll and wldap32.dll.  Both are placed in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory if
the user is running Windows 95 or WINNT\SYSTEM32 if the user is running
Windows NT.
